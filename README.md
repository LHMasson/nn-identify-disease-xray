📥 How to Set Up and Run on VS Code
🔹 Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/LHMasson/nn-identify-disease-xray.git
cd nn-identify-disease-xray
```

🔹 Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
```

🔹 Install Dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

🔹 Install the Jupyter Extension on VS Code
In VS Code, open the Extensions panel (Ctrl + Shift + X).
Search for "Jupyter" and install the extension.
Restart VS Code after installation.

🔹 Open and Run Notebooks
Open the project folder in VS Code.
Click on notebooks/nn.ipynb.
Make sure to select the correct virtual environment as the kernel.
Run the cells one by one (Shift + Enter).

📄 Conclusion
This project explores convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for medical image analysis and can be expanded to other types of diagnostic imaging.
